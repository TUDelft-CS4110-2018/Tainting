# Tainting

In order to practice tainting, we are going to follow the proof of concept form Jonathan Salwan: http://shell-storm.org/blog/Taint-analysis-and-pattern-matching-with-Pin/

In this example, we will use Intel Pin, or Pintool: https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool
